# Rodney
A Discord bot developed in JavaScript using the discord.js Library.
At this point in time the bot will not be supporting multiple guilds at once during the development period of the Beta process.

If you are having troubles and/or issues setting up the bot, please leave an issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/shadowolfyt/RodneyTheDiscordBot/issues) or join my [Discord](http://bit.ly/mancavediscord).

## Requirements
- A channel named `#audit-log`, otherwise notifications will not come in and errors will occur.
- A channel named `#reports`, otherwise reports will not be received and errors will occur.
