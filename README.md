# Rodney
A Discord bot developed in JavaScript using the discord.js Library.
At this point in time the bot will not be supporting multiple guilds at once during the development period of the Beta process.

## Requirements
- A channel named `#audit-log`, otherwise notifications will not come in and errors will occur.
- A channel named `#reports`, otherwise reports will not be received and errors will occur.
- A file named `warnings.json` to keep track of warnings and the Automatic Punishment Escalation System, not making this file will result in the `warn` command not working.
- A file named `token.json` to put your bot token into, this file doesn't come automatically, it will have to be created manually, not making this file will result in the bot not booting.
